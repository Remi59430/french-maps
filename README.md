## Instructions

- the region to be found is chosen randomly
- we have several attempts to find the region
- once all the regions have been found, a victory message is displayed and the total number of attempts made

## Bonus

Provide 3 levels of difficulty :
- easy (unlimited trials)
- medium (3 trials per region)
